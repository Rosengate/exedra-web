# Framework
One major benefit on using a low-cost microframework is, you get to choose the tons of awesome component made by our PHP community out there!
For example simply visit :
- [https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php)
- [https://thephpleague.com](https://thephpleague.com) 

Or if you want to try something fast, maybe we can suggest you a sample composer build :

```json
{
  "require": {
    "rosengate/exedra": "~0.9",
    "twig/twig": "^2.0",
    "vlucas/valitron": "v1.4.0",
    "vlucas/spot2": "v2.2.0",
    "league/event": "v.2.1.2",
    "nesbot/carbon": "1.22.1",
    "symfony/console": "^3.0"
  }
}
```
