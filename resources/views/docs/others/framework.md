# Framework
Exedra isn't intended in any way to be another full-fledge framework. However, it still feels lacking having number of core components missing like view, validation, orm, database abstraction  and so on.

Maybe we can suggest you a good composer build using tons of available packages out there.

```json
{
  "require": {
    "rosengate/exedra": "~0.9",
    "twig/twig": "~1.0",
    "vlucas/valitron": "v1.4.0",
    "vlucas/spot2": "v2.2.0",
    "league/event": "v.2.1.2",
    "nesbot/carbon": "1.22.1"
  }
}
```
